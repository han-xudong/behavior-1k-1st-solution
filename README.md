# BEHAVIOR Challenge Solution

**1st Place | Public Leaderboard: 26% | Private Leaderboard: 26%**

This repository contains our winning solution for the [2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge](https://behavior.stanford.edu/challenge/), achieving a 26% success rate on both the public and private evaluation sets. Our approach builds upon [Physical Intelligence's Pi0.5](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0) vision-language-action model with several architectural and training innovations.

## 🏆 Solution Summary
We use policy based on Pi0.5 and built on top of [openpi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) repository.

**Key Architecture Changes:**
- Replaced language model with 50 trainable task embeddings (no text processing)
- Correlated noise for Flow Matching: noise is sampled from N(0, 0.5*I + 0.5*Σ) instead of independent noise, where Σ is the action correlation matrix
- Each layer of the Action Expert attends to linear combination of all VLM layers KV (learnable weights)
- Attention: Images and task embeddings bidirectionally attend to each other, stage (system 2 - see below) and robot state bidirectionally attend to each other and to images and task embeddings, FAST tokens attend to all mentioned above + causally to each other, Flow Matching attends to everything except FAST tokens and attends to each other bidirectionally

**Key Training Changes:**
- Multi-step Flow Matching: 15 action expert predictions (with different time and noise sampled) per each VLM step to reduce training variance
- Delta action space with per-timestamp normalization
- Extra FAST auxiliary loss with 0.05 weight (no knowledge insulation)
- 0.1 weight for subtask prediction loss (system 2 logic, see below)
- Trained on 224x224 RGB images + proprioception states only

**System 2 Implementation:**
- Predicts current task stage (5-15 stages per task solely based on the timestamps) as auxiliary output from VLM (using only images and task embeddings)
- Stage tracking with voting logic for smooth transitions and non-Markovian resolution, passed as input to the model (using mix of sin encoded subtask state and learnable embeddings)

**Inference Optimizations:**
- Soft inpainting: predict 30 actions, execute 26, keep 4 for next prediction for inpainting. Inpainting is soft (only first 70% of the denoising steps are inpainted) and correlation aware (the rest of the actions are guided towards the linear regression prediction for them from the original 4 actions).
- 1.3x speedup via cubic interpolation (26 predicted actions are executed in 20 steps). Speed up is disabled when gripper state is changing
- General correction rule: open gripper after failed grasp attempts.
- Extra hardcoded correction rule for radio tasks (probably not important but is kept as a legacy).
- We use 4 checkpoints of the same model for different tasks. They were initially trained on 50 tasks simultaneously but later split and finetuned on the separate subsets of tasks.


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone with submodules (includes openpi and BEHAVIOR-1K)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ilialarchenko/behavior-1k-solution.git
cd behavior-1k-solution

# Run setup script (installs uv, dependencies, and sets up environment)
bash setup_remote.sh
```

### Dataset Preparation

Download the official BEHAVIOR-1K dataset from HuggingFace:

```bash
# Login to HuggingFace (need to avoid request rate limit errors)
uv run huggingface-cli login

# Download the full dataset (~2TB)
uv run python - <<'PY'
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(
  repo_id="behavior-1k/2025-challenge-demos",
  repo_type="dataset",
  local_dir="./data/behavior_dataset",
  local_dir_use_symlinks=False
)
PY
```

**Alternative**: Use the resized RGB-only dataset (224×224, ~260GB) for faster training:
```bash
uv run python - <<'PY'
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(
  repo_id="IliaLarchenko/behavior_224_rgb",
  repo_type="dataset",
  local_dir="./data/behavior_224_rgb",
  local_dir_use_symlinks=False
)
PY
```

### Configuration

Update paths in `src/b1k/training/config.py` (lines 334-378) as needed:

```python
repo_id="behavior-1k/2025-challenge-demos",
behavior_dataset_root="/path/to/data/behavior_dataset",
assets_base_dir="/path/to/outputs/assets",
checkpoint_base_dir="/path/to/outputs/checkpoints",
```

### Pre-training Setup

Compute dataset statistics and train FAST tokenizer:

```bash
# Compute normalization statistics with correlation matrix
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats.py --config-name pi_behavior_b1k_fast --correlation

# Train FAST tokenizer for action discretization
uv run scripts/train_fast_tokenizer.py \
  --config-name pi_behavior_b1k_fast \
  --encoded-dims="0:6,7:23" \
  --vocab-size=1024
```

**Note**: If using pre-trained checkpoints, you can skip this step and copy assets from the checkpoint directory.

### Training

Login to Weights & Biases for experiment tracking (optional):

```bash
uv run wandb login
```

**Single GPU Training**:
```bash
uv run scripts/train.py pi_behavior_b1k_fast \
  --batch_size=16 \
  --num_train_steps=200000 \
  --save_interval=2000 \
  --keep_period=10000 \
  --log_interval=100
```

**Multi-GPU Training**:
```bash
uv run scripts/train.py pi_behavior_b1k_fast \
  --batch_size=2048 \
  --num_train_steps=200000 \
  --fsdp_devices=8 \
  --save_interval=250 \
  --keep_period=4000 \
  --log_interval=25
```

Adjust batch size and other parameters to your needs.

We used Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) - for training that allows to use a bigger batch size on multiple GPUs. openpi supports other multi-GPU modes but they were not tested and not used in this project. Please set `fsdp_devices=<number of GPUs>` to avoid any issues.

Use `--overwrite` to start a new training and overwrite existing checkpoints or `--resume` to continue training from the last checkpoint. `--resume` works only with the same number of GPUs as the original training.


### Fine-tuning

You can initialize model weights either from already pretrained checkpoint or from Pi0.5 model (in this case all new parameters will get initial/random weights). Specify it in the training config. Our solution was initialized from Pi0.5 base model. 

```python
weight_loader=weight_loaders.PiBehaviorWeightLoader("/path/to/model/params")
```

### Evaluation

Start the policy server:

```bash
uv run scripts/serve_b1k.py policy:checkpoint \
  --policy.config pi_behavior_b1k_fast \
  --policy.dir /path/to/checkpoint
```

In a separate terminal, [run evaluation](https://behavior.stanford.edu/challenge/baselines.html) (requires BEHAVIOR-1K environment):

```bash
python BEHAVIOR-1K/omnigibson/learning/eval.py \
  log_path=./eval_logs \
  policy=websocket \
  task.name=make_microwave_popcorn \
  model.host=localhost \
  eval_instance_ids="[0,1,2,3]"
```

**Note**: this repo supports only our modification of the model developed for the competition, if you want to use Pi0.5 or Pi0 policies, use original [openpi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) repository.

## 📦 Pre-trained Checkpoints

We provide 4 specialized checkpoints that we used for our competition submission. We initially trained them on all 50 tasks but later split and finetuned on the separate subsets of tasks. It was mostly done because of the time and resources constraints, we believe that longer training on 50 tasks can achieve comparable results.

All checkpoints are available on HuggingFace in the same repository: [🤗 Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/IliaLarchenko/behavior_submission)

You can download them together or one by one.


| Checkpoint | Task Count | Task IDs |
|------------|------------|----------|
| **Checkpoint 1** | 20 tasks | 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 34, 42, 44, 47, 48 |
| **Checkpoint 2** | 16 tasks | 0, 1, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 30, 43, 45 |
| **Checkpoint 3** | 13 tasks | 4, 27, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 46, 49 |
| **Checkpoint 4** | 1 task | 40 |

You can run evaluation using all 4 checkpoints at once by configuring it in the `task_checkpoint_mapping.json` file. The policy will use the checkpoint corresponding to the task_id received from the server.

```bash
uv run scripts/serve_b1k.py --task-checkpoint-mapping task_checkpoint_mapping.json \
    policy:checkpoint \
  --policy.config pi_behavior_b1k_fast \
  --policy.dir ~/models/checkpoint_1 #path to any checkpoint
```

We also provide the intermediate checkpoint achieved after the first stage of the model training (simultaneously on 50 tasks). It is not the part of the final submission. 
We didn't properly evaluate it on the full dataset but our guess is that it can achieve around 15-20% q-score. You can find it [here](https://huggingface.co/IliaLarchenko/behavior_50t_checkpoint).
